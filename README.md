This application has been created following the microservice approach. 03 teams were developing different aspects (i.e. Frontend, API1 and API2) of the application. Also, due to the nature of such applications different technology stacks were used during the development. 

# Technologies used
Frontend - Javascript (Framework7)   
API1 - JAVA Springboot, PostgreSQL RDS instance  
API2 - Node.js, mongoDB  

Also, another requirement was to have 03 separate environments to facilitate development. In this case environments are named as dev, staging and prod.
